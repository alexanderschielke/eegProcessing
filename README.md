Some essential functions for preprocessing and analyzing eeg data and creating source models as well as extracting relevant sources for follow-up analyses


egiPReprocess: Read and preprocess neurostim files and mff files for experiment and eeg data within the sib framework

prepareSourceModel: create a source model based on "The FieldTrip-SimBio pipeline for EEG forward solutions. (Vorwerk et al., 2018) and the fieldtrip toolbox

doSOurceAnalysis: combine source model and data from SSVEP experiment for further analyses based on source space
